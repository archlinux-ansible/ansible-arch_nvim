# arch_nvim

Role to configure my nvim plugins.

Depends on the [packages](https://github.com/archlinux-ansible/ansible-arch_packages) and [chezmoi](https://github.com/archlinux-ansible/ansible-arch_chezmoi) roles.

This role is not meant to be general purpose - it is used for bootstrapping my personal machines.
